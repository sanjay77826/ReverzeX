Here is a detailed breakdown of the available commands:


Once the tool is running, you will be prompted to enter the file path of the malware file you wish to analyze:

```
Enter file path: sample_malware
```


1. **Analyze File**: Disassemble and analyze the opened file. This includes disassembling the binary and analyzing its contents to identify instructions, functions, and other key elements.

   ```bash
   Command: 1
   ```

   Command: 2
   ```

3. **List Functions**: List all functions identified within the file. This can be useful for understanding the capabilities and behavior of the executable.

   ```bash
   Command: 3
   ```

4. **File Metadata**: Retrieve and display detailed metadata information about the file, such as file type, size, hash values, and timestamps.

   ```bash
   Command: 4
   ```

5. **Calculate Threat Score**: Query VirusTotal to calculate and display a threat score based on the file's reputation and analysis results from multiple antivirus engines.

   ```bash
   Command: 5
   ```

   ```bash
   Command: 6
   ```

7. **View File History**: Display the history of the file, including creation time, last analysis date, and first submission to VirusTotal.

   ```bash
   Command: 7
   ```

8. **Basic File Properties**: Show basic properties such as hash values (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256) and file size, which can be useful for identifying and comparing files.

   ```bash
   Command: 8
   ```

9. **List Threat Categories**: List potential threat categories identified during analysis, such as ransomware, spyware, or trojans.

   ```bash
   Command: 9
   ```

## Configuration

### Threat Intelligence API Key

To leverage the threat intelligence features of ReverzeX, you must configure the tool with your VirusTotal API key. Follow these steps:

1. Open the `threat_intelligence.py` file in a text editor:

   ```bash
   nano threat_intelligence.py
   ```

2. Locate the line where the API key is set:

   ```python
   self.api_key = "your_api_key_here"
   ```

3. Replace `"your_api_key_here"` with your actual VirusTotal API key.

4. Save the file and exit the editor.

### Network Capture Configuration

ReverzeX uses `pyshark` to capture and analyze network traffic. By default, it captures traffic on the primary network interface. If you need to capture traffic on a specific interface or apply filters, you can modify the capture settings in the `network_capture.py` file.

## Logging

ReverzeX logs all its activities and analysis results to a log file located in the `logs` directory. The log file is named `reverzex.log`.

### Accessing Logs

To view the logs:

```bash
cat logs/reverzex.log
```

Logs include timestamps, command execution details, error messages, and analysis results, providing a detailed record of your usage.
